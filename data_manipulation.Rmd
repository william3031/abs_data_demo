# Introduction

This is just a notebook to demonstrate how to load and manipulate Census datasets in R.

## Markdown notes

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Load libraries

We are going to use the following:

* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) - this is a package of packages including `dplyr` which is used for data manipulation. 
* [sf](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) - this is the spatial features package. This makes it easy to work with spatial data using tidyverse syntax.
* [janitor](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html) - this package makes it easy to remove empty rows and columns as well as clean variable names.

```{r}
#### the first time you use a package you will need to install it.
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("sf")
# install.packages("janitor")

# load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)

# if you want, you can load packages like pacman, which make it easier to load lots of packages.
```

Note: this (%>%) is a pipe and is used in the tidyverse syntax to join processes together. the shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+M

# Load datasets
```{r}
# sa1 data
sa1_shp_raw <- st_read("data_in/shp/SA1_2016_MV.shp") %>% 
  clean_names()

# languages spoken at home  - this file has been cleaned up previously
lang_raw <- read_csv("data_in/SA1_2016_LANP.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

# household composition - this one has extra rows on the top and bottom that needs to be deleted - this has been downloaded from tablebuilder
hhcd_raw <- read_csv("data_in/SA1_2016_hhcd2.csv", skip = 9) %>% # skip the top nine rows
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(count)) %>% # this gets rid of the bottom rows
  filter(hhcd_2_digit_level != "Not applicable") %>% 
  select(-x5) # sometimes an extra column gets read in when the data is in this format from Tablebuilder

# view them
sa1_shp_raw
lang_raw
hhcd_raw
```

# Manipulate data
## Languages spoken at home

```{r}
lang <- lang_raw %>% 
  select(-counting) %>% # drop this column
  rename(sa1 = sa1_ur) %>% # rename the column
  filter(!lanp_4_digit_level %in% c("English", "Not stated")) %>% #filter out these
  arrange(sa1, desc(count))  %>% # arrange by these columns
  mutate(sa1 = factor(sa1)) %>% # converts the sa1 varialbe to factor (a type of character field) to match the shapefile
  mutate(count = as.integer(count)) # convert to integer
lang # just to have the output below
```

```{r}
# pivot the data wider
lang_wide <- lang %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "lanp_4_digit_level", values_from = "count") %>% 
  arrange(sa1) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.), 0L) # replace the empty cells with 0 as an integer
write_csv(lang_wide, "data_out/lang_wide_2016.csv") # export to csv
lang_wide
```



```{r}
# top languages
lang_1 <- lang %>% 
  group_by(sa1) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% # takes the top language by the group
  rename(lang1 = lanp_4_digit_level, lang1_count = count)

lang_2 <- lang %>% 
  group_by(sa1) %>% 
  slice(2) %>% 
  rename(lang2 = lanp_4_digit_level, lang2_count = count)

lang_3 <- lang %>% 
  group_by(sa1) %>% 
  slice(3) %>% 
  rename(lang3 = lanp_4_digit_level, lang3_count = count)

lang_top3 <- left_join(lang_1, lang_2, by = "sa1")  %>% # join everything together
  left_join(lang_3, by = "sa1")
write_csv(lang_top3, "data_out/lang_top3_2016.csv")

lang_top3
```

## Lone person households

```{r}
# select the columns that I want
hhcd_ <- hhcd_raw %>% 
  select(sa1 = sa1, hhcd_2_digit_level, count) 
```

```{r}
# caluculate the lone person households
lone_pers_hh <- hhcd_raw %>% 
  group_by(sa1) %>% # group by sa1
  select(-counting) %>% # drops this column
  mutate(pct = round(count/sum(count)*100, 1)) %>% #calculate a percentage rounded to one decimal place - this is for all groups
  filter(hhcd_2_digit_level == "Lone person household") %>% # we only want lone person households
  filter(!is.na(pct)) %>% # get rid of the ones where there isn't a value
  filter(sa1 != "Total") %>% # there might have been totals in the original input file
  ungroup() %>% # need to ungroup first as sa1 is used as the grouping variable so can't be mutated in the next step
  mutate(sa1 = factor(sa1)) # converts the sa1 varialbe to factor (a type of character field) to match the shapefile
write_csv(lone_pers_hh, "data_out/lone_pers_hh_sa1_2016.csv")

lone_pers_hh
```

# Spatial joins

```{r}
sa1_shp <- sa1_shp_raw %>% 
  select(sa1 = sa1_7digit) # just select sa1 and rename it. it will also keep the geometry column too unless we drop it

sa1_shp
```

## Join to languages spoken at home
```{r}
sa1_lang_shp <- sa1_shp %>% 
  left_join(lang_1, by = "sa1")
st_write(sa1_lang_shp, "data_out/shp/sa1_lang.shp", delete_layer = TRUE) # output - the delete layer just overwrites anything

sa1_lang_shp

plot(sa1_lang_shp) # this is just a very quick plot for the demo. there are plenty of ways to make better maps using other packages such tmap, mapview or cartography
```

## Join to lone person households
```{r}
sa1_lone_pers_hh_shp <- sa1_shp %>% 
  left_join(lone_pers_hh, by = "sa1")
st_write(sa1_lone_pers_hh_shp, "data_out/shp/sa1_lone_pers_hh.shp", delete_layer = TRUE) # output - the delete layer just overwrites anything

sa1_lone_pers_hh_shp

plot(sa1_lone_pers_hh_shp) # this is just a very quick plot for the demo. there are plenty of ways to make better maps using other packages such tmap, mapview or cartography
```
